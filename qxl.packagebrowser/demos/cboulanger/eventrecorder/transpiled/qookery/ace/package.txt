The Qookery ACE plugin allows to use the ACE editor in qookery forms     The main minified ACE source file must be named ace.js and reside in   <code>${q:external-libraries}ace<code>. Additional ACE files may exist   alongside for additional themes, workers etc. To get the editor working,   the minimal set is "ace.js" and "theme-eclipse.js".     You will need to download a version of the editor with the required plugins   yourself. This can be done manually, or via the included ANT task in build.xml.     If you are using the javascript compiler, add the following code to your   compile.json file:     <pre>   "include": [  	"qookery.",  	"qookery.ace."  	...   ]   <pre>
